-Overworld movement, including entities, map loading, and the like.

-Cutscenes.

-Basic UI system (For passing data to something the player can view, like a textbox.)

-Rough inventory system (Just enough that there's hooks for the quest system)

What ISN'T going to be in SOL

-Character data structures

-Battle systems

-Pretty much anything not generic and common amongst most JRPGs.
